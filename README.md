# Intelligent-Neural-Network-Optimization-with-Evolutionary-Algorithms


Intelligent Neural Network Optimization with Evolutionary Algorithms is a project aimed at exploring the use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize the performance of neural networks (Conf of weights). Neural networks are powerful machine learning models that have shown great success in a variety of domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. However, designing and training neural networks can be a challenging task, particularly when dealing with large, complex models.

The aim of this project is to investigate how evolutionary algorithms can be used to optimize neural network layers weights and hyperparameters. This involves developing a framework that integrates neural network with evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization. The framework will be used to evaluate the performance of different optimization strategies on a range of Bank loan classification dataset.

# Evolutionary Algorithms

Evolutionary algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms that are inspired by biological evolution. They work by maintaining a population of candidate solutions and iteratively applying selection, mutation, and crossover operations to produce new generations of solutions. These algorithms have been used successfully in a variety of optimization problems, including those in machine learning.
